rticle 1：My Literature Search Journey

Date: January 15, 2023

Today I started my literature search process. I turned on my computer, ready to start my research. I first opened my browser and entered the keywords of my research topic. I used some common academic search engines, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect.

My search started off well and I got some articles related to my research topic. I started looking at the abstracts of these articles one by one to see if they were relevant to my research. I also checked the references of these articles to find others that might be helpful.

However, my search quickly ran into some difficulties. I found that some articles are not open access and require payment to view the full text. This frustrates me a bit as I don't have the funds to cover these expenses. However, I did not give up and continued trying to find other available resources.

I started searching the school library's website to see if they had books and journals related to my research. I also looked at some open access academic resources, including PLOS and BioMed Central, among others. I've found that these resources provide a wealth of useful articles that help me delve deeper into my topic.

During my search, I found some interesting articles that could help me answer my research questions. I started reading the articles, saving them on my computer, and taking summaries and notes. I also use citation management software to organize my references and notes for easy citation when needed.

During my search, I also learned some useful tips and tools. I learned how to use Boolean operators and quotation marks to refine my search results, and how to use citation management software to organize my references and annotations. These skills will be very useful in my future research.

Although I had some challenges with my search, I ended up finding some very useful resources. I have now started reading these articles and look forward to further exploring my topic in future research	.
