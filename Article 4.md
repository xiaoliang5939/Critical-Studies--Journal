Article 4:The Importance of Programming Literacy in the Digital Age
Date: February 10, 2023

Literacy, traditionally defined as the ability to read and write, has been a fundamental aspect of human civilization for centuries. However, as technology has advanced, so has the concept of literacy. Today, the ability to understand and use computers and programming languages ​​is an increasingly important component of literacy. In this post, I will reflect on what literacy means in the modern age, and what it means to be called computer programming literacy.

Traditional concepts of literacy focused on reading and writing skills, which are still important today. Literacy means the ability to understand and interpret written text, and to express oneself in writing. However, in today's society, with the rapid development of computer technology, programming ability is particularly important, so the ability to control digital technology has become crucial. With so many aspects of our daily lives now mediated through digital platforms, a lack of digital literacy can be a significant barrier to fully participating in society.

In this context, computer programming literacy has become a valuable skill. Essentially, programming literacy refers to the ability to understand and write code in a programming language. This can involve a variety of tasks, from writing simple scripts, to writing your own digital artwork in code, or automating tasks, to developing complex software applications. In many ways, programming literacy is a form of problem solving. By learning to program, individuals learn how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable pieces and develop solutions to those problems by writing code.

However, programming literacy is more than just technical skills. It also involves critical thinking, creativity and collaboration. Programming requires individuals to think logically and systematically, to try out different approaches, and to be able to modify their code based on feedback. It also involves the ability to collaborate with others, whether that's collaborating on a code base or seeking help from online communities.

Calling computer programming literacy "literacy" is not without controversy. Some see programming as a professional skill, and calling it "literacy" confuses different types of knowledge. However, I think programming literacy is a valuable form of literacy in its own right. It involves many of the same skills as traditional literacy, such as the ability to read and interpret written text, communicate effectively, and solve problems. Additionally, given the increasing importance of technology in our lives, it is imperative that individuals develop an understanding of how technology works and the ability to engage with it in meaningful ways.
